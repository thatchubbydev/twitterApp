    You guys are on my mind
    You asked me what I wanted to be
    And now I think the answer is plain to 
    see
    I want to be famous
    I want to live close to the sun
    Well, pack your bags cause I've already won.
    Everything to prove nothing in my way
    I'll get there one day
    Cause I want to be famous
    Nanana'nanaana nana nana na na na na na naa
    I wanna be, I wanna be; I wanna be famous
    I wanna be, I wanna be; I wanna be famous

    You take the moon and you take the sun.
    You take everything that seems like fun.
    You stir it all up and when you're done,
    You share a big piece with everyone.
    So come on in, feel free to do some looking,Stay a while, 'cause something's always cooking!Come on in, feel free to do some looking,Stay a while, 'cause something's always cooking!Yeah! `,

    Wings of silver, nerves of steel
    Silverhawks!
    
    Partly metal, partly real
    Silverhawks!
    
    Soaring though the highways of the heavens in their flight
    Silverhawks, a rainbow in the night!
